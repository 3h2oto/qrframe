# QR Framework

Blatantly inspired by [Anthony Fu's QR Toolkit](https://qrcode.antfu.me)

The QR code generation is powerd by [`fuqr`](https://github.com/zhengkyl/fuqr), my own Rust library imported as WASM.

I'm using [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com), [`kobalte`](https://kobalte.dev) UI components with styling loosely based on [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and of course [`unocss`](https://unocss.dev/) for this quick and dirty project.
